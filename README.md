# script_tools
Collection of basic javascript tools

# Contents
- script_tools:
  Folder with the scripts.
  - advancedCreateE:
    returns a html element based on the parameters.
  - parseTablableData:
    returns a html table based on the information you supply it. No style, just a simple table. I recommend DataTables for something pretty (you may find you can use my script as a base for DataTables).
- examples:
  A wide collection of (five) htmls that demonstrates how to use the functions.

# How to use
Copy the scripts to wherever you want to use them. Then you can access the utility function with your own script.

The utility functions are:
 - script_tools.advancedCreateE (aka, add$)
 - script_tools.parseTablableData

I recommend you to check out the examples.

# btw
It is compatible with IE (at least the last version, I don't intent to test it everywhere).
